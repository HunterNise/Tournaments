abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; Tournament solution concepts, selecting winners based on a pairwise dominance relation are an important structure often used in sports, as well as elections, and argumentation theory. Manipulation of such choice rules by coalitions of agents are a significant problem in most common rules. We deal with the problem of the manipulation of randomized choice rules by coalitions varying from a single agent, to two or more agents. We define two notions of coalitional manipulations of such choice rules based on whether or not utility is transferable. We show useful choice rules satisfying both notions of non-manipulability, and for the transferable utility case provide bounds on the level of Condorcet consistency. &lt;/p&gt; },

abstract="A tournament on n agents is a complete oriented graph with the agents as vertices and edges that describe the win-loss outcomes of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}left( {\{}{\backslash}begin{\{}array{\}}{\{}c{\}}n{\backslash}{\backslash} 2{\backslash}end{\{}array{\}}{\}}{\backslash}right) {\$}{\$}n2matches played between each pair of agents. The winner of a tournament is determined by a tournament rule that maps tournaments to probability distributions over the agents. We want these rules to be fair (choose a high-quality agent) and robust to strategic manipulation. Prior work has shown that under minimally fair rules, manipulations between two agents can be prevented when utility is nontransferable but not when utility is completely transferable. We introduce a partially transferable utility model that interpolates between these two extremes using a selfishness parameter {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}$\lambda$. Our model is that an agent may be willing to lose on purpose, sacrificing some of her own chance of winning, but only if the colluding pair's joint gain is more than {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}$\lambda$times the individual's sacrifice.",
