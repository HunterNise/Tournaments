abstract="A tournament on n agents is a complete oriented graph with the agents as vertices and edges that describe the win-loss outcomes of the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}left( {\{}{\backslash}begin{\{}array{\}}{\{}c{\}}n{\backslash}{\backslash} 2{\backslash}end{\{}array{\}}{\}}{\backslash}right) {\$}{\$}n2matches played between each pair of agents. The winner of a tournament is determined by a tournament rule that maps tournaments to probability distributions over the agents. We want these rules to be fair (choose a high-quality agent) and robust to strategic manipulation. Prior work has shown that under minimally fair rules, manipulations between two agents can be prevented when utility is nontransferable but not when utility is completely transferable. We introduce a partially transferable utility model that interpolates between these two extremes using a selfishness parameter {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}$\lambda$. Our model is that an agent may be willing to lose on purpose, sacrificing some of her own chance of winning, but only if the colluding pair's joint gain is more than {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}$\lambda$times the individual's sacrifice.",
